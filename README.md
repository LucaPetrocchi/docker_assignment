# DOCKER DEVOPS ASSIGNMENT

## Set-Up Steps

These steps assume you have Docker installed.

1. Open Docker desktop & console of choice.
2. Navigate to whichever path these files are stored in.
3. Run 'sudo docker build -t [name of choice]'. This will create a Docker image.
4. Run 'sudo docker run -d -p 5005:5005 [name of choice]'. This will create your container.
5. Navigate to your localhost, port 5005. There are two available routes: 'home' and 'contact'. Neither have much content.
